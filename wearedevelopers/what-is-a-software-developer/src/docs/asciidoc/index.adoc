== Drew Eckhardt's Answer

* Solving hard technical problems other people canâ€™t.
* Coming up with neat ideas, implementing them, and seeing your vision work.
* Working with great people and doing more than you can as an individual.
* Growing other engineers so they are stronger and faster.
* Crushing competition. I love the smell of exponential growth in the morning, it smells like victory.

image::do-not-disturb.jpg[size=center]

== What Is The Flow?

Flow, also know as zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

+++<aside class="notes">+++
The flow is the mental state of operation where you are fully concentrated, were you are productive, were you have fun and might pull an all-nighter.
+++</aside>+++

== Flow & Software Developers

As software developers we occasionally get to experience that glorious state of productivity where we are in the zone, time flies by, and features come flowing out of us.

+++<aside class="notes">+++
We love to be in the flow.
It is hard to enter the flow
It even harder to remain in the flow
+++</aside>+++

== Disturbing The Flow

* Noise
* Meetings
* Unscheduled interruptions
* Waiting for something

== Waiting For Something?

+++<aside class="notes">+++
When we finished our work we need to build the software and test it
That takes time - sometimes a long time
